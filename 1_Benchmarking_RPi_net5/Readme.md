## Instructions

If your Raspberry pi is not already set up to run .net 5 run the following script


    wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CarlSargunar/carlcodes_support/master/Support/install_net5.sh | sudo bash

Alternatively if you have cloned the repo and wish to install this locally

    sudo chmod +x install_net5.sh
    sudo ./install_net5.sh


Once you have dotnet running, please update + reboot your device
